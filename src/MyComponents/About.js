            <p> <b><i>"Singh's Cafe"</i></b> is a restaurant that does not offer table service. Customers order their food from a counter and serve themselves. A cafe menu traditionally offers things such as coffee, espresso, pastries, and sandwiches. Cafes originated in Europe and are strongly associated with France. They are known for their casual, unhurried atmosphere. Panera Bread is an example of a popular bakery-cafe chain.
            The term bistro is sometimes interchanged with a cafe. A bistro is actually a cafe that offers full meals (albeit, cheaper than a full-fledged sit-down restaurant).
            </p>

            <p><b><i>"Casual Style Dining"</i></b> is also known as family-style dining in the United States. Casual style restaurants offer moderately priced entrees. This is one of the largest markets in the US right now. Causal style dining can be any number of themes, from Italian (Olive Garden) to seafood (Red Lobster) to Mexican (Chilis). Casual style restaurants offer tableside service, non-disposable dishes, while still keeping the menu moderately priced. </p>

            <h2>Our Delivery Services</h2>

            <p><b><i>1 : Variety of delivery options - </i></b> If you don’t already, make sure you add a number of delivery options for your customers to choose from. As mentioned earlier, next-day delivery has become the norm and any business not offering this will feel the repercussions in sales. The more options you provide, the happier your customers will be.</p>

            <p><b><i>2 : Choose the right logistics company- </i></b>There’s one costly mistake you can make with your delivery service and that’s choosing the wrong courier. Don’t simply look at the cost when choosing the right courier for your company. You need to ensure you’re using an affordable yet reliable courier service in order to keep your customers happy. Some small businesses may run their delivery service alone but once orders increase a courier is vital in order to take this stress away and allows you to concentrate on other parts of the business.</p>

            <p><b><i>3 : Tracking parcels- </i></b>A large amount of orders can cause confusion which is why it is recommended that parcels are tracked. This allows the business to monitor every parcel that is sent out and if a problem occurs this can be rectified quickly, as the last whereabouts of the parcel is known.</p>

            <p><b><i>4 : Delivery price- </i></b>Customers particularly appreciate free or discounted delivery options. Many companies offer free delivery if a customer spends a set amount. Special delivery offers can encourage additional spending and draw in more customers to your business. It could be the difference between a customer going elsewhere to purchase the same product. Although it may seem like you are losing out on money, reduced delivery prices could increase sales.</p>

            <p><b><i>5 : Customer Satisfaction- </i></b>Customers are the most important factor in e-commerce businesses and therefore customer satisfaction must be the main priority in everything you do. This is no different when providing a delivery service. Customers want communication from the beginning of their experience. This includes offering clear delivery service options on the website and acknowledgement of the order after purchase on screen and via email. Customers rely on updates and this highlights to them that a company cares about them receiving their delivery. Deliveries can lead to a customer planning their day around it, so providing a time slot for delivery can ensure customers are satisfied with their experience and will shop with you again.</p>
